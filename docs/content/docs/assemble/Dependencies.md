# Dependencies

## Artifactory

Free version of [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) used in Avito Android development to be a proxy for every 3-rd party dependency.

Dependency resolving performance and artifacts availability is crucial for our CI/CD pipelines and developers local work.

If you have new dependency, which is not listed in available proxies, please [contact]({{< ref "/docs/Contacts.md" >}}) our team.
