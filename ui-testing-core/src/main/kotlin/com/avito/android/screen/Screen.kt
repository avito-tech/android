     * Also used to link "Screen" PageObject and "Screen" (android.view.View) in app code
     * for impact analysis in ui tests
     *
     * <WARNING>
     * Use only direct implementation(ex: rootId = R.id.root)!
     * Not lateinit or custom getters to init property
     * Static code analyzer for impact analyze works on bytecode level and couldn't extract value otherwise
     *
     * if apps's screen is in separate module, there can be multiple equal id's, like:
     *  com.avito.android.authorization.R.id
     *  com.avito.android.R.id
     * Even worse, if there is a name clash (ex: id.root in multiple modules) LAST ONE! ends up in com.avito.android.R.id
     * Last one means last module in resource merge process
     * We could get different isOpened results based on module merge ordering :crazy:
     * So you better import fully qualified package name for R class of your module in Screen implementation
     * </WARNING>
