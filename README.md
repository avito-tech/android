# Infrastructure of avito-android project

## Disclaimer

Right now this project is just a way for us to work as open as possible,\
and share ideas and its implementation with community.

If you plan to use some parts of our code, please let us know, \
because we don't have any public API stability guarantees atm. 

However, all code you see in `develop` is running right now in Avito,\
and we rely on it to test and ship our apps.
